# Week35-HelloWorld
## Introduction
Hello students! I am your Teaching Assistant, Alexander Linde Lossius. My job will be to provide you all with assistance, and create excercises for you to work on during lab time. If you need any help or encounter problems during please @ me in the class discord, my discord ID is herrkrabbe.

My plan for this week's excersises are

1. Set up a Github account
2. Cloning this project
3. Opening Visual Studio Solution
4. Coding

I am expecting all parts to take a while, because of a multitude of problems you can't predict beforehand. So remember to share the solutions to the problems you are facing, and ask others for help!
## Part 1: Setting up Github
The first thing you need is an account on this website, so go make one.

Welcome back! Now you will need a good way to download a git project onto your PC. Personally I use git Bash and Git Kraken because they enable more advanced control git; Most sudents in my class prefer to use Github Desktop. [There is a multitude of options!](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis). So choose whatever you want, here are my recommendations.

### Git Bash
[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a terminal for using git commands. It allows for full functionality of github, and is nice to have if you ask me to resolve issues with your other options. Such issues will include merge issues, but you will find out about those when you encounter them.

In addition to downloading Git Bash you will also need to [set up Git on your PC](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git). I use SSH keys on my computer, and they work quite well.

### Github Desktop
[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) has a nice UI, and makes downloading and uploading easy without needing to set up an SSH key.

### GitKraken Desktop
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) is an advanced user option, for when you want ease of use from Github Desktop and the control of Git Bash. GitKraken costs money, but is free for students if you are part of [Github Education](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student).
